# Usage
There is a bash script named ``make_opencv.sh'' which can be used to compile the source code:

    bash make_opencv.sh orb_match.cpp

After compiling the source, just run the code by typing:

    orb_match <source image> <method: 0 or 1>

The pics folder has some photos for my own test, and you shall put in yours.
